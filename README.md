# PeerHoo

PeerHoo is a student built app brings together UVA students through allowing students to match, communicate in real-time, and share/access notes for any UVA course! It aims to create a collaborative and at-your-fingertips environment to help UVA students study smarter. This project was part of academic coursework for **CS 4720 Mobile Application Development** at the University of Virginia.

## Purpose

The purpose of this app is to be a platform for uva students to find study partners in the same classes as them, share and access other peopleâ€™s notes (all the notes have an associated rating and comments that help the user pick which notes to access, and users can also rate and add comments), chat with their study partners in real time. Students can fill out a course matching form to request study partners based on their classes and preferences. Once matched, they can message each other through a real-time chat system. Students can also upload their notes in image or PDF format, which are stored and displayed with author info, ratings, and comments. PeerHoo includes a search and filter system to help students quickly find relevant notes for the course. Additionally, students have personalized profile pages where they can edit their bio, upload an avatar, and manage their courses, notes, and matches.

Here's some detailing of each of the larger features:

### Study Partner Matching
- Students add themselves to a course they are taking by fillin out an "Add Course" form by inputting course numbers and study goals
- After that, they can browse matching results with student profiles
- They can click to view avatars, bios, and contact information of these other students
- Finally, they can click "Apply" to connect with students in your courses
- Likewise, other students can apply to connect with you and you can accept of reject their application

### Real-Time Chat
- Once connected with a peer, you can message them
- The chat is real-time so it helps student collaborate and "text" each other without sharing their private numbers
- The interface is very user-friendly as it ressembles any standard chat interface (such as iMessage or Instragram)

### Note Sharing System
- Users can upload notes via pdf or image input
- Users can browse and search notes by course
- Users can rate and comment on study materials (and they can edit both their reviews and comments, and also delete their comments)
- Each note has a detailed note views with title, author, rating, content, and comments

### User Profiles
- Users can customize their bio and avatar

### Blocking and Reporting System
- Users can block and/or report their study partners
- Once someone is blocked, the blocked personnel will not be notified. However, the user who blocked them will nto recieve any message or interaction from the blocked personnel.
- Users can also manage their blocked partners and unblock any or all of them at anytime

## Development Timeline

This entire project was completed over a 25-day development cycle. In the beginning of these 25 days, we defined our timeline to be the following:

- **Week 1**: Authentication and basic UI setup
- **Week 2**: Matching system and chat implementation  
- **Week 3**: Note sharing functionality
- **Week 4**: Testing, refinement, and deployment

However, due to the enthusiastic approach of all of the team members, we were able to implement features much faster than expected and were done with the working version of our app as early as the beginning of Week 3. We used the extra time to beta test our app as well as seek feedback from our Professor Daniel Graham. We used the final week for the creation of our demo video and final submission of the project.
